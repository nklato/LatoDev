The website is built with a modern tech stack focused on performance, responsiveness, and maintainability. I utilized HTML5, CSS3 (with Sass for modular styling), and JavaScript for the front-end. For dynamic interactions and smoother transitions, I implemented CSS animations and lightweight JavaScript libraries to enhance the user experience.

To ensure scalability and ease of future updates, the website follows a component-based structure. This allows for easier management of individual sections like the welcome screen, project gallery, and any future additions like the blog page. The layout is fully responsive, meaning it's designed to look great on any device, from desktop to mobile.

Features:
-Responsive design: Ensuring it works well on various screen sizes.
-Smooth animations: Subtle transitions enhance the user experience, with more animation planned for the welcome screen to make it even more engaging.
-Modular project showcase: Each project is showcased with future plans for mock-up images for a more visual presentation.
-Version control with Git: All updates and iterations of the site are managed via Git, and the code is hosted publicly on GitHub.

I am continuously improving the website. Future updates include:
-Enhanced animations on the Welcome screen.
-Mock-up images for projects on the Projects page.
-A blog section to share insights, tutorials, and more.

If you're interested in how the site is built, feel free to explore the GitHub repository where all the code is available.
