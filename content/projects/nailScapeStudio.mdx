The website was built using Next.js, a powerful React-based framework that enables server-side rendering and optimized performance. Next.js was chosen for its ability to create a highly responsive and SEO-friendly website, while also offering a smooth user experience.

Key Features:
-Custom Admin Dashboard: A standout feature of the NailScape Studio website is the fully functional admin dashboard, built to allow the business owner to easily manage and update the portfolio. Through the dashboard, the user can add, edit, or remove portfolio entries (including images and descriptions) without needing any technical expertise. The back-end is powered by Next.js API routes and a MySQL database for storing the portfolio data, making the entire process seamless and efficient.
-Responsive Design: Built to be fully responsive, the site offers a smooth browsing experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops. This ensures that users can explore the salon's portfolio and services with ease, no matter where they are.
-Interactive Portfolio: The portfolio section showcases high-quality images of the salon’s work, with a lightbox feature for users to view detailed images. The site structure allows easy expansion, making it future-proof as the portfolio grows.
-Contact and Booking Integration: The site includes integrated contact and booking forms, streamlining the process for clients to schedule appointments or get in touch.

Technologies Used:
